useState() is part of a special category of functions called hooks, each of which can be used to add new 
functionality to a component.

We import useState from React and call it inside our functional component. 
The hook takes an initial state as an argument and returns an array with two elements:

Current State: The current value of the state.
State Setter Function: A function that updates the state.

In video example:

const [count, setCount] = useState(0); initializes the state with count set to 0.
count holds the current state value.
setCount is the function used to update count.

The useState hook allows the Counter component to manage and update its internal state, which in this case is the number of times a button is clicked.


/////////////////////////////////


how to set multiple states at once? 
we use previousSate or preState. eg:
setCount((previousSate) => previousSate + 1)

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATE AND PROPS: 

1) Source:
Props: Received from the parent component.
State: Defined and managed within the component.

2) Purpose:
Props: Configure child components and pass data from parent to child.
State: Manage data that changes within the component and affects its rendering.

3)Mutability:
Props: Immutable and read-only.
State: Mutable and can be updated by the component.

4)Lifecycle:
Props: Passed down the component tree and only change when the parent component re-renders with new values.
State: Local to the component and persists across re-renders until updated.
